Project Debrief:

This was a fun project to practice using Grid, instead of Flexbox, which I have been accustomed to. I can see the pros/cons of both and am very excited to keep experimenting with Grid. The first couple containers went well, as I added more it become slightly more difficult, but by the end I was adjusting things no problems. Going forward I feel very confident that I could replicate this design in half the time it took me to do it in this run.
